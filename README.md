# Decision Tree Computation for Animal Classification
This repository features a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the application of decision tree algorithms to an animal classification assignment. The notebook covers:

Decision Trees in Machine Learning: A common supervised learning technique used to model and predict outcomes based on input data. The decision tree structure resembles a tree, with internal nodes testing attributes, branches representing attribute values, and leaf nodes indicating conclusions or predictions.

Animal Classification: Using a decision tree to classify animals into mammals and non-mammals based on various features.

# Files
animal_classification.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with code for implementing and visualizing the decision tree model.
Dataset
The dataset includes information about various animals with attributes such as whether they are warm-blooded, give birth, or are aquatic creatures. The goal is to classify them into two categories: mammals and non-mammals.

# Installation
Ensure you have Python and the following packages:

pandas
scikit-learn
pydotplus
matplotlib
Install the packages with:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn pydotplus matplotlib
Usage
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Train a decision tree classifier.
Visualize the decision tree.
Evaluate the model's accuracy.
Results
The decision tree model is evaluated based on its accuracy in classifying test data.
